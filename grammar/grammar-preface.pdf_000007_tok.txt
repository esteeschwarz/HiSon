PREFA
CE
.
K
nation
,
whofe
education
is
perhaps
a
little
too
much
neglected
,
may
here
find
a
familiar
and
unaffected
inſtructor
,
lefs
ſolicitous
to
diſplay
his
own
abilities
than
to
improve
theirs
.
As
this
work
is
chiefly
calculated
for
the
youth
of
both
ſexes
,
as
well
as
for
foreigners
who
are
deſirous
of
learning
our
language
,
I
have
taken
the
utmoſt
care
to
adapt
it
to
either
claſs
of
learners
.
This
has
been
attempted
by
others
,
but
never
ſo
fully
before
;
and
the
want
there
was
of
a
good
practical
Grammar
in
all
our
ſchools
induced
me
firft
to
bend
my
ſtudies
towards
ſupplying
the
defect
.
It
was
my
deſign
to
draw
up
fuch
a
work
as
might
lead
the
young
ſcholar
into
a
knowledge
of
Engliſe
,
in
the
fame
manner
as
he
learns
Freuch
or
any
other
modern
language
.
In
it
I
have
included
all
the
parts
of
Engliſb
ſpeech
,
and
have
given
upon
every
part
fuch
well
-
grounded
rules
as
the
affiduity
of
others
might
have
poited
to
me
,
er
my
own
induſtry
found
uſeful
.
Nor
have
I
been
leſs
careful
in
my
examples
to
thofe
rules
;
the
reader
of
diſcernment
will
probably
perceive
them
various
and
appofite
,
at
once
ferving
to
illuſtrate
the
precept
,
and
entertain
the
imagination
.
Some
benefit
may
be
alſo
derived
from
their
copiouſneſs
,
as
they
may
anfwer
the
purpoſe
of
an
Engliſp
vocabulary
,
furnifhing
a
number
of
words
which
the
