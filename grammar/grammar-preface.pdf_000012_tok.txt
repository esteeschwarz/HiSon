that

in

;
and
ſo
of

Thus
the
ſcholar
will
at
length
come
to
have
apreciſe
idea
of
the
value
of
every
letter
,
and
give
it
upon
every
occaſion
,
its
proper
pronunciation
.
As
to
Foreigners
,
they
ſhould
firſt
be
taught
the
vowels
,
in
the
Engliſh
manner
,
whuch
is
very
different
from
the
manper
in
which
they
are
pronounced
by
other
nations
,
and
then
they
ſhould
be
ſhewn
their
changes
in
compoſition
.
Above
all
things
,
they
ſhould
be
well
grounded
in
the
Engliſb
orthography
,
for
which
purpoſe
,
they
fhould
be
conſtantly
employed
mn
ſpelling
words
,
from
one
to
five
or
ſix
ſllables
,
and
in
reading
lome
of
our
beſt
authors
,
or
even
the
news
papers
,
the
teacher
all
the
time
diligently
attending
and
correcting
any
vicious
pronunciation
,
and
laying
down
the
rules
for
every
correction
.
Nor
fhould
the
right
placing
the
accent
be
ever
omitted
;
for
this
purpole
care
fhould
be
taken
to
refer
the
learner
to
that
part
of
Grammar
,
in
which
pronunciation
is
chiefly
the
object
,
ſo
that
he
may
be
able
to
judge
for
himſelf
of
the
propriety
of
every
accent
,
which
might
to
the
inattentive
appear
the
refult
of
accident
only
.
And
here
,
perhaps
,
in
this
Grammar
,
while
he
ſeeks
after
the
drynefs
of
precept
,
he
may
be
agreeably
furprized
with
the
fallies
of
imagiation
