ſome

,
his
tutor
ſhould
be
very
careful
to
explam
it
,
to
ſhew
him
the
peculiar
elegance
of
every
expreflion
,
and
to
point
out
which
are
obſolete
,
or
which
but
lately
introduced
into
the
language
.
The
learner
fhould
not
only
be
thus
employed
in
reading
,
but
in
writing
extracts
from
thoſe
bocks
,
and
even
ſhould
get
ſome
of
the
moſt
ſtriking
paffages
by
heart
.
By
theſe
means
.
having
amaffed
a
fund
of
beautiful
metaphors
and
cxquifite
deſcriptions
,
he
may
be
at
length
ſet
to
compofe
ſomething
either
in
profe
or
verſe
,
either
a
letter
or
an
epiſtle
,
which
ſhould
be
firſt
corrected
ſeveral
times
by
himſelf
,
and
then
by
his
tutor
,
whoſe
buſi
⸗
neſs
it
fhould
be
conſtantly

ſo
far
as
to

Such
are
the
helps
given
,
and
fuch
are
the
difficulties
to
be
furmounted
in
attaining
a
perfect
knowledge
of
our
language
;
a
language
,
which
the
reft

Europe
have
been
but
lately
made
acquainted
with
,
and
which
they
now
regard
as
a
new
diſcovered
mine
of
the
richeft
oar
.
This
language
is
now
cultivated
by
all
the
polite
world
abroad
,
while
our
countrymen
ſeem
fupinely
negligent
of
it
at
home
.
