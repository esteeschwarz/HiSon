theſe
,

ſay
,
are
always
pointed
out
,
ſo
that
Foreigners
and
Natives
,
at
a
diſtance
from
the
capital
,
may
be
taught
,
as
far
as
Books
can
teach
,
to
give
every
word
its
true
pronunciation
and
proper
accent
.
When
we
thus
aſcertain
the
difference
between
ſpeaking
and
writing
,
it
in
fome
meafure
prevents
the
future
deviations
of
language
,
and
hinders
fafhion
from
introducing
barbarous
affectation
into
our
ſpeech
,
and
deters
the
orthographitt
from
writing
the
language
exactly
as
it
is
vicioufly
pronounced
.
As
the
inſtruction
of
Foreigners
was
no
inconſiderable
part
of
my
aim
in
this
work
,
I
have
not
only
been
thus
afliduous
in
directing
their
pronunciation
,
but
have
alſo
added
rules
for
ſuch
as
underſtand
the
Latin
.
Italian
,
Prench
,
Spaniſb
,
Portugueſe
,
Dutch
,
and
other
modern
languages
,
in
order
to
fhew
the
near
affinity
between
theſe
and
our
own
.
The
natural
gradation
from
one
language
to
another
is
pomted
out
in
numerous
examples
,
in
a
more
diftinct
and
conſpicuous
manner
than
in
any
thing
of
this
kind
ever
yet
publifhed
;
ſothat
we
can
at
one
view
ſee
how
far
our
language
is
original
,
and
how
far
we
are
indebted
to
others
for
its
variety
,
richneſs
,
and
beauty
.
This
part
of
my
undertaking
has
never
been
attempted
before
by
any
author
in
the
ſame
manner
;
I
have
,
therefore
,
the
timidity
incident
to
every
man
,
who
adventures
into
an
unfrequented
region
,
folicitous
to
make
new
