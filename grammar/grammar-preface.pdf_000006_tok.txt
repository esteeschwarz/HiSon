PREFACE
.
1K
that
I
will
venture
to
affirm
,
that
thofe
,
who
never
had
the
leaft
acquaintance
with
Latin
,
may
,
by
the
proper
uſe
of
this
Grammar
,
become
at
once
capable
of
writing
Engliſhr
with
correctneſs
,
elegance
,
and
preciſion
.
here
is
ſtill
another
obſection
,
which
ſome
are
too
apt
to
make
,
and
with
which
they
endeavour
to
palliate
their
own
indolence
;
this
is
no
other
than
that
Engliſp
may
be
very
well
learned
without
any
Grammar
whatſoever
;
but
in
this
they
moſt
certainly
are
decewed
,
for
though
it
is
poflible
a
young
gentleman
or
lady
may
ſpeak
with
tolerable
propriety
upon
ſome
particular
fubjects
,
yet
when
they
come
to
write
,
even
though
it
be
but
a
letter
,
their
deficiency
will
ſoon
appear
,
and
with
this
aggravating
circumſtance
,
that
their
name
is
generally
ſigned
to
that
which
lerves
as
a
teſtimony
of
their
defect
.
We
acknowledge
,
indeed
,
that
if
they
purlom
from
printed
letters
,
they
may
flourifh
at
a
cheap
expence
,
but
not
a
volume
of
theſe
can
anſwer
all
the
ordinary
occurrences
of
life
.
To
ſuch
young
gentlemen
or
ladies
,
therefore
,
as
deſire
to
write
with
correctneſs
,
and
at
the
ſame
time
decline
the
intricacies
of
a
learned
education
,
a
work
of
this
kind
muſt
be
abſolutely
requiſite
,
and
I
have
accordingly
endeavoured
to
make
every
part
of
it
obvious
to
the
meaneſt
capacity
.
Either
Foreigners
,
or

Fair
Sex

our
own
