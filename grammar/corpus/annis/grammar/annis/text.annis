B F C E . all parts of learning which N our countrymen have cultivat * L R , during this century , with fuccess , their own language seems to be that wheremn their efforts have been most weak or . They stand justly foremost in other branches of , and even their language is now considered by Foreigners as absolutely requisite to complete a learned education ; yet the themselves , either ignorant or unmindful of the they pofless , have carelelly suffered it to be adulterated by ignorance , or affectation . Like Kings panting after new conquests , they have indolently permitted their natural dominions to fink into desolation . It must be owned , indeed , that many writers have been of late employed in drawing up Grammatical Eflays on the tongue , incited , perhaps , by the rent PREFACE . rent utility of the design ; but , probably , not sufficiently apprized of the labour which was to attend the undertaking . Thus we find them contenting themselves with driving their heavy labours in the track of former error . and never venturing from the beaten road in quest either of beauty or improvement . It is true , however , that in these there are often found some good grammatical instructions , which we have taken care to and improve ; yet the rules in all are so intricate and indigested , and so manifestly deficient , and even false in several places , that all but the writers be convinced of the of another attempt to reduce our language into system . This I have undertaken ; the errors of others I have taken care to correct , but the reader must judge for whether I have substituted any of my own . Yet if the reader the number of prejudices to be in a work of this kind , and the many obsections to be , which either ignorance Or vanity has thrown in our way , he will not be to find us , while intent upon correcting the deviations of others , sometimes guilty of deviation ourselves . We were not only to guard the errors of the ignorant , but the delusions of the learned . It has been by the latter , for instance , that m order to produce a complete Grammar of our language , we imitate the Latin in the formation PREFACE . of our , Moods , and ; whilst others , on the contrary , affirm , that the tongue has no similitude whatever with the Latin in this respect , and therefore they are for preventing our making use of the common terms ufually employed in Grammars of our language : We have taken the liberty to from both , and offer the present work as a proof that their opmions are erroneous . This Grammar will to that our language may be reduced to , without the of adhering so closely to the Latin as has been hitherto thought ; but , at the same time , care has been taken not to so far from that language as to discard those grammatical terms borrowed from it , and which have acquired , by long use , a prescriptive right to be admitted into our own . Nothing but an excess of ridiculous affectation induce some Grammarians to make use of new and barbarous terms , of already well enough known to every novice in Grammar . The mere reader frequently of the terms Noun Adjective , Verb or Adverb , and can probably tell what they mean from their frequent occurrence ; but as for their modern substitutes , such as Name , Forename , Adname , and such like , he is quite at a loss to know their meaning , and as much information to lead him into their etymology as was requisite in the Latin terms themielves , but with this P REF ACE . , . . this disadvantage , that he may never meet with these again ; whereas the Latin terms may probably occur in the next book he has to . In order , therefore , to avoid such needlefs affectation , I have retained the common appellations of the several parts of speech ; studious rather of improving things than words , as the perfection of an artist rather m making the proper of known instruments , than in forming new for every occasion . Others have with more plausibility . that the Latin Grammar was the by which to learn , and that , m order to come at the true construction and orthography of our own language , we should for both in the Roman tongue . But , whatever weight this might have with an or Spaniard , languages have a near resemblance to the Latin , yet it can weigh but little with an learner , who is to write a language very different both in sound and formation . If we were to learn any dialect previous to our own , it might , perhaps , with the greatest propriety , be the Saxon ; from whence the greatest part of ours is derived , and with which it the nearest af . . The words which are merely of Latin do not make up one fourth part of the tongue ; how then can the Latin be so absolutely towards completing the learner ? It is so far otherwise , that PREFACE . that I will venture to affirm , that , who never had the acquaintance with Latin , may , by the proper use of this Grammar , become at once capable of writing with correctness , elegance , and precision . here is still another , which some are too apt to make , and with which they endeavour to palliate their own indolence ; this is no other than that may be very well learned without any Grammar whatsoever ; but in this they most certainly are , for though it is a young gentleman or lady may speak with tolerable propriety upon some particular fubjects , yet when they come to write , even though it be but a letter , their deficiency will soon appear , and with this aggravating circumstance , that their name is generally signed to that which as a testimony of their defect . We acknowledge , indeed , that if they from printed letters , they may at a cheap , but not a volume of these can answer all the ordinary occurrences of life . To such young gentlemen or ladies , therefore , as desire to write with correctness , and at the same time decline the intricacies of a learned education , a work of this kind must be absolutely requisite , and I have accordingly to make every part of it obvious to the capacity . Either Foreigners , or the Fair Sex of our own nation , CE . K nation , education is perhaps a little too much neglected , may here find a familiar and unaffected instructor , lefs solicitous to display his own abilities than to improve theirs . As this work is chiefly calculated for the youth of both sexes , as well as for foreigners who are desirous of learning our language , I have taken the utmost care to adapt it to either class of learners . This has been attempted by others , but never so fully before ; and the want there was of a good practical Grammar in all our schools induced me to bend my studies towards supplying the defect . It was my design to draw up a work as might lead the young scholar into a knowledge of , in the fame manner as he or any other modern language . In it I have included all the parts of speech , and have given upon every part well - grounded rules as the of others might have to me , er my own industry found useful . Nor have I been less careful in my examples to rules ; the reader of discernment will probably perceive them various and , at once to illustrate the precept , and entertain the imagination . Some benefit may be also derived from their copiousness , as they may the purpose of an vocabulary , a number of words which the PREF ACE . the scholar will in the other parts of the work be taught to dispose , and thus make exercifes from both in prose and verse . I have also fully and clearly explamed the construction of all the parts of speech ; and have given the declensions of Articles , Nouns , and Pronouns , and the conjugation of all sorts of Verbs , both regular and irregular , at full length . At the end of every part of speech are several short praxes and remarks , calculated for those who have made a deeper progrefs in grammatical disquisitions . Nor have I been less in directing the proper manner of pronouncing our language , than in the art of . In this respect , almost all Foreigners find the greatest difficulty , and demand the able instructor . To pronounce our language with propriety , untinctured with provincial accent , foils even several Natives of our own empire ; those therefore , I flatter myself , may by this Grammar in some remedy the defect . I have taken the utmost care to settle and mark the accents upon every word , so that its pronunciation may be precifely , except when the irregularity of our language absolutely rendered an . However , the redundant letters , which we as well as the , have admitted into our language ; letters which are always to be written yet are never pronounced , these , CE . these , 1 say , are always pointed out , so that Foreigners and Natives , at a distance from the capital , may be taught , as far as Books can teach , to give every word its true pronunciation and proper accent . When we thus ascertain the difference between speaking and writing , it in the future deviations of language , and hinders from introducing barbarous affectation into our speech , and the from writing the language exactly as it is vicioufly pronounced . As the instruction of Foreigners was no inconsiderable part of my aim in this work , I have not only been thus in directing their pronunciation , but have also added rules for such as understand the Latin . Italian , , , Portuguese , Dutch , and other modern languages , in order to the near affinity between these and our own . The natural gradation from one language to another is out in numerous examples , in a more and conspicuous manner than in any thing of this kind ever yet ; we can at one view see how far our language is original , and how far we are indebted to others for its variety , richness , and beauty . This part of my undertaking has never been attempted before by any author in the same manner ; I have , therefore , the timidity incident to every man , who into an unfrequented region , to make new disco - CE . discoveries , yet if , ready to acknowledge my mistake . As I have been thus solicitous to add to the grammatical store , by my own labours : equal pains have been used to retrench the former superfluity of others ; a work of this kind should abound with all the rules . to instruct , but not to embarrafs : it is designed not to gratify vain speculation , but to be converted into practical utility . It would have been needless , therefore . to engage the attention upon fubjects not immediately useful ; or to the page , as others have done , with a multiplicity of notes collected from the Ancients , relative to the definitions , divisions and subdivisions of ; all these the learned are to know already , and the ignorant will find it a at first to understand the more material parts of the art , without diving thus into the recefles of antiquity for labour . Such a needlefs display of our abilities would only increase the Size , and consequently the price , of this volume ; and at the same time hours which the scholar might have more profitably employed in studying the rules of the language . There is a delicate simplicity in all the works of art , and this simplicity Grammar sometimes ; let us , therefore , not admit foreign ornaments into a work of this kind , and thus destroy the force of our precept by the errors of our example . a PREFACE . Thus much with regard to the nature of the work offered to the public , it to lay something of the manner of employing it , and the uses to which it may be applied . In learning any of the living languages , the great is to attain the proper pronunciation , on which , in a great , all its harmony and force . In learning therefore , not Foreigners alone , but even themselves , be carefully instructed in this part of the language , by which means they will avoid provincial and local dialects , which are too often found in the mouths even of some who would be thought polite , Of all other languages , perhaps , our own the greatest care in this respect , the different manner in which numbers of words are pronounced and written , being so very anomalous , that many . even of the natives , can never attain the true sound without . At this part , therefore , it will be ablolutely for the young scholar to ; and it should be the business , whether master or mistress for this work is equally calculated for both to him , by the help of Grammar , the various sounds that every particular letter , or of letters , is capable of admitting ; thus he may be taught , for instance , that the has different sounds , it is sounded like the French masculine é on most occasions , as in face , place ; it a sound like the French a , as in tall , fall ; a feminine or weak found , as man , can ; and PREFACE . these , , art , cart . <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & sc . and that it is sunk almost entirely in the words Bargain , Captain ; and so of the rest . Thus the scholar will at length come to have idea of the value of every letter , and give it upon every occasion , its proper pronunciation . As to Foreigners , they should first be taught the vowels , in the English manner , is very different from the in which they are pronounced by other nations , and then they should be their changes in composition . Above all things , they should be well grounded in the orthography , for which purpose , they be constantly employed mn spelling words , from one to five or six sllables , and in reading lome of our best authors , or even the news papers , the teacher all the time diligently attending and correcting any vicious pronunciation , and laying down the rules for every correction . Nor the right placing the accent be ever omitted ; for this care be taken to refer the learner to that part of Grammar , in which pronunciation is chiefly the object , so that he may be able to judge for himself of the propriety of every accent , which might to the inattentive appear the of accident only . And here , perhaps , in this Grammar , while he after the drynefs of precept , he may be agreeably with the fallies of , as I have taken care at proper intervals to insert leflons , which like spots of verdure a 2 in PRE F A CE . in an Asiatic wild , may serve at once to afford the weary traveller reft and refreshment . The pronunciation thus settled , the next care should be to instruct his pupil in the declension of nouns , and the conjugation of some verbs , as they stand in the Grammar ; and these the scholar should by all means get by heart , as in learning the Latin or languages ; but with respect to the remarks and other speculative rules , a diligent will be . As to the ornaments of style , they are fitter for the more advanced student than our beginner , however , the teacher should not totally omit this part of his education . instruct him in the elegance of , rather by example than by mere precept . He appoint him as a , either to speak after , or transcribe the best authors , and his own taste direct to the models to copy from . Were I to beginners , especially children , they should read only such Beoks as are casily understood , and written in the most plain and natural style , upon subsects capable of interesting the virtuous part of their paflions , or those which lead to Vice . Nor can I here avoid recommending several of this nature , published by Mr . , which seem happily adapted to delight and rectify the growing mind , and lead it up to truth , through the flowery paths of . PREFACE . , both in and verse , will allo be a proper instructor ; and as they advance , books of a higher strain , and a more speculative turn , may be put into their hands with safety , as the Spectators , , Guardians , the Rambler , Idler , and Adventurer , and a few other periodical pieces of a later date ; these , with perhaps the works of our great poet Mr . Pope , will open their minds to all the beauties of our admirable language , and at once both its strength and concifeness . From this stage of education , the scholar may next proceed to , in which extensive field , that of his own nation ought certainly to be preferred . Every , how destitute soever of other riches , has one inestimable treasure , his country ; . that , and all its advantages , it should be at once his and his to be thoroughly . Nor should the pupils delivery or manner of reading be omitted among the rest of his institutions ; for this , perhaps , those works which we have in blank verse are extremely proper , and a portion from one of every day be first read by the master , with the proper pauses and just emphasis , and then the scholar should imitate him , as far as his abilities will permit . When he is at aloss for the PREFACE . ing in some of these productions , his tutor should be very careful to it , to him the peculiar elegance of every , and to point out which are obsolete , or which but lately introduced into the language . The learner not only be thus employed in reading , but in writing extracts from those bocks , and even should get some of the most striking paffages by heart . By these means . having a fund of beautiful metaphors and descriptions , he may be at length set to something either in or verse , either a letter or an epistle , which should be first corrected several times by himself , and then by his tutor , ness it be constantly to refer him to his Grammar for a just disposition of the Syntax , and to go so far as to make him give an account of every part of speech which his , and to each to the general praxis on Grammar , laid down in the page of the present work . Such are the helps given , and are the difficulties to be in attaining a perfect knowledge of our language ; a language , which the reft of Europe have been but lately made acquainted with , and which they now regard as a new discovered mine of the oar . This language is now cultivated by all the polite world abroad , while our countrymen seem fupinely negligent of it at home . The fupineness of my countrymen 10 PREFACE . is furely an object of contempt or , to see them neglecting their own language , as not worth cultivation , when the judicious Spaniards have made a dictionary of theirs , containing six volumes in folio ; when the French have made it a national concern to spread theis among all the courts of Europe , and have taken this as one of their routs to empire . This neglect I have among others attempted to obviate . Tongues , 40 . the ingenious Mr . like governments , have a natural tendency to degeneration . We have long our constitution , let us make some struggles for our language . A noble this , and whatever may be my strength , vet as the same ardour , which excited him , me , I offer a champion in the same glorious ; though perhaps with much inferior abilities , yet being and by others Works , there is a of making Grammar more complete than they have left it . They have , it must be granted . from a variety of stores the materials for the edifice , by coming after them , perhaps , it has been my fortune to give the materals the artful arrangement . Mr . Greenwood , upon this obferves , that no such thing as a complete Grammar was to be expected from any one person , and indeed his own Grammar , which though perhaps one of the best hitherto extant , is certamly no contradiction to the truth of his general PREFACE . XX general ; yet after all , something complete may from the application of different abilities to the same undertaking , and I will venture to offer the present work , as the complete of the kind that has yet among us . I am not insensible , however , of the of the public at this juncture , and their dis - inclination either to examine a work of labour , or to do it justice when examined . I know how it is for vanity to a right of judging even without the pains of reading , and how often some have been found to a palace , who were unable perhaps to build up a hovel : Yet still I have strong expectations from the candour and discernment of many . superior abilities have taught them to know , that even mediocrity in so difficult a work deserves .

The aforegoing twenty - fix Letters of the English Alphabet are divided into Vowels and Consonant . A Vowel is a Letter which makes a perfect Sound of itself . There are five in Number , a , e , i , o , u , to which may be added-y ; but this having the same Sound as i at the latter End of Words , we need not make it a distinct Vowel . A Complete . Grammar . A Consonant is a Letter that cannot be sounded without adding a Vowel either before or after it , as m , which is , and p as pe . It comes from the Latin Consonans , because it consones , or sounds with another Letter . . . i A Syllable is a perfect Sound made of one or more Letters , expressed in one Breath , as , Ca - larmi - ty . are four distinct Syllables . i The Quantity of required to form a Syllable are generally any Number under ten , as in these Words , I , be , / be , that , thing , though , thought , thoughts , straights . . . . The Quantity of . required to form a Word are seven or eight at the most , as Re - con - - li - ati - on , Ra - ti - o - - na - ti - on , In - com - pre - ben - f bi - li - ty . It may be observed that any of the five Vowels with a Consonant make a Syllable , but without a Vowel it cannot be formed , for Consonants alone spell nothing , as fr , but join o to them , which is a Vowel , and fr - o - m spell from , and so of numerous other Instances of the like Kind : But I ll not si much upon these si and Distinctions , it being su just to have mentioned them , and to observe in general that of Letters are formed Syllables , of Syllables Words , and of Words Sentences , which are what compose or make up the whole of all the Parts of Speech contained in any Language .

I ll now proceed to 4 Further and more for Pronunciation upon all the Letters of the English alphabet . A Is a Vowel whose Sound is so simple as to be formed only by the opening of the mouth ; it is generally pronounced among us with a smaller and more slender Sound than among any other Nations , exactly in the lame Manner as the French do their Diphtong ai in jamais , never , and their . masculine in nn , given , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c , It has two Sorts of Sounds in the Formation of Words , which like those of the French may be distinguished into masculine , i . e . broad , as all , tall , fall , and into feminine , i . e . weak or slender , as Man , can , pan , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . which last Words are long or short , according as they stand by themfelves or are joined by the silent e , of which I ll speak hereafter . It is also pronounced weak and short when ll or nn are parted in the Middle of a Word , as , dally , rally , Pannic , Fanny , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . It is short in Monosyllables not ending with e , as mad , had , bat , fat , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . and in Polysyllables , when followed by two Consonants , as etel , ests , admire , , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & ec . A Complete GRAMMAR . It is lost or funk at the End of most Words in , as Bargain , Captain , Chaplain , Curtain , Fountain , Mountain , Murrain , Plantain , Pillain , all which are pronounced Bargin , Captin , Chaplin , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . as also in the following Words , weak , , bead , spread , boat , coat , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . as may be mote fully in treating of a redundant . It is obscure , or not plainly pronounced in these Words , Carriage , Marriage , Parliament , Thousand : Also observe , there are mone but proper Names that end with this Vowel , except the following seven that sound only the e , as lea , flea , plea , pea , a , tea , yea , which last Word is become almost obsolete . It has the Sound of u at the End of the following Words , as Altar , Angular , Calendar , Jocular , Medlar , Pedlar , Pillar , Solar , Scholar , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . and is often superfluous at the Beginning , as abide , amend , arise , awake , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . for , bide , mend , rise , wale , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . : Observe , no English Word begins with two aa , except Aaron , which is rather a Hebrew name ; and where a is double in the Middle of Words , as it is in many Scripture Names , drop one in the Pronunciation , as Isaac , Balaam , Canaan , except Baal , Gaal , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . . Note , Our Alphabet seems to want a Letter , or some Sort of Character equivalent to it , to express the Sound we give a , as in the Words all , aall , , , balt , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . B Is called in Latin Litera labializ , the Labial or LipLetter , because it cannot be pronounced without closing the Lips together . It retains its natural Sound at the Beginning of all Words , as bad , bed , , hut ; but is not always pronounced in the Middle , as in the Word doubt and Compounds , and is never used double at the End et Words . It founds like two , in double , , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . It serves , like e final , to lengthen the Syllable in these following , chimb , bomb , comb , tomb , wamb . It is entirely redundant at the End of many Words , as may be among the redundant , . It is double A Complete ENGLIsH GRAMMAR . double in abbot , abbesi , ably , , , lobby , bobby , bobble , cobble , . Before a , o , u , I , , is always hard like k , as cat , cot , cup , , crab , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . though these Words seem more natural to be wrote with k , as the Dutch do in Pakker ; but before e , i , and y , it is always sounded soft likes , as cellar , city , . It has also the Sound of in , ascend , disciple , and also in Words that have an Apöstrophé , denoting the Absence of e , as plac\'d , trac\'d , tor placed , traced , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & ec . We have no Occasion to use the c Cedilla of the French , or Plica of the Portuguese , because . the same being invented purely to supply the Defect in the Combination of ce , , in the Vowels a , o , u , as ça , co , cu , which sounds sa , f , su . whenever the hard Sound-of c comes before the Vowels e , i , or y , in English the Letter <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & is always put in its Stead , as ken , tin , kind , Keyneton . But where this Letter e has a loft Sound at the End of a Syllable , or before a Consonant , or the Vowels a , o , u , we usually add the silent e , to render the Sound still softer , as , förce , . Most Words ending in the Sound of ace , ece , ice , ece , uce , must be written with ce and not se , except these Words , base , abase , debase , cease , decrease , increase , géese , concise , paradise , promise , dose , loese , use , recluse , abuse , abffruse , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & ec . Also most Words ending with the Sound of ance , ence , ince , once , and unce , must be written with e between-n and e , and not , except in these Words following , dense , condense , dispense , terse , intense , sense , propense , suspence . It has a peculiar Sound before b , like tch , as chance , cherry , chip , chop , chuck , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . but in chymist , , . it is hard like , as will be seen afterwards , when we treat of peculiar Sounds . Allo when double before a Consonant it is sounded hard like 4 , and shorter than single c , as acclamation , accord , accomplice , account , accrue , accumulate , accuse , occur , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . but before the Vowels e and i , the first is hard , and the second like an 4 . .

Verb be , . which are sounded long like es ; to which may be added the following Names , Cle , . , Phebe , Penelope , . , and all other Words of foreign Extraction , su as , . , si , . , . , apöstrophe , for , as . . said , the single e is seldom or never pronounced at the End of Words ; but whenever it is , it is . by another silent e added to it , as fe , fie , fee , free , lee , glee , knee , tree , three , Pharisee , uce , and also the Pronoun . , and the Substantive Bee , an Insect , so wrote to . them from the , the Article , and he , the Verb ; or else . added to it , as sea , pea , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & ec . or by adjoining the . , as . . . , Henley , . . though the e is now left out , as . , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . . beginning to prevail in . of it . 1 ll not here trouble the Scholar with an elaborate Account of the Original of this silent , the Use of it as it now stands of much more Importance to him ; let . , that although the silent e be not now pronounced , yet it is not altogether nn , for it serves for two Purposes , first , to . or lengthen the aforegoing Vowel , and , . , to soften the Sound of e , g , and . , as in these Words , ince , . , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . which if e were omitted , would sound harder and stronger , as finc , bug , breath , besides that it . quite a different Meaning to the same Word , as may be more amply seen in the List of Words , treating of silent ⸗ . Words that end in silent e , whether they he . compounded , or receive an additional Termination , do yet retain it if there be Occasion , and then it has the same Force as it had . , but it is scarce ever found in the Middle of a Word , unless it were originally a final e ; so these Words , miles , graves , liver , . , . , finely , changeable , chargeable , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . do all retain the silent e , because it was . and silent in mile , grave , life , . , rare , fine , change , charge , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & ec . Here it is not sounded in the Plural , because it was A Complete . GRAMMAR . was not in the Singular ; however observe , that the e , which is silent in the si Number , is often pronounced in the Plural , as bouse , houser , vice , vi , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . not sounded nor wrote in the following . , . , lands , . , but in . , . , . , . , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . the here sounded , not because it was a mute e , but because it . to the personal Termination . at the End of . . . It has the Sound of u in all the following Words , Her , anger , auger , adder , adulterer , ll , . , fodder , crupper , daughter , flipper , liberty , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . It is pronounced like a in . and . . The Sound of ee is very long , being to be pronounced like the . i in ido , gone , as bleed , creed , deed , feed , need , . , freed , heed , weed , . , sen , been , where both . are sounded together as one Letter ; but in the following compound Words the two concurrent Vowels must be distinctly pronounced , like the Spanish in leer , to read , as re - enter , re - . , pre - . , and allo where i is joined to e , as reinstate , reinforce , and e to a , as reassume , . , reanimate , beatitude , . , theatre , create , creator , and e to o , as Creole , preordain , preoccupy ; but these Words , creature , iu , and the like , are excepted , the Accent laying entirely on the first e , with the Force of ee , as will afterwards be shewn , when we treat of redundant Letters . It begins double only in this one Word , eel . The following Words compleat , repleat , . , . , are indifferently wrote , complete , replete , extreme , su , but this last Manner is the best , as being nearest the original Latin , from whence they are derived . When e is joined to m or . at the Beginning of Words , it is generally pronounced like i , as embrace , employ , entire , engage , . , except , enter , entertainment . It is entirely silent in bear , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c , as may be . in the List of Words treating of e redundant . d , . GRaMMaR . 10 By some is . a mute Consonant , by others a semi - vowel . It has with us much the lame Sound as the Grest o , for which Reason some affirm , that in Words of . . we should write ph , and only in those of ati Original . As to F at the End of Words , the . f seems quite superfluous , except in off , as keep off , carried off , gone of , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . which is to . it from the Particle ef . But . has . in the following Words , viz . cliff , . . stiff . . . . . buff , bluff , . : buff . muff . . . . a . . , rebuff . It is pronounced loft like , in the following man ⸗ ner of si , what of bim , as though it were wrote , what ow him , and sometimes is left out , as what . that , i . e . . of that . The Dutch write and pronounce wader , i . e . father , which . the great affinity off and o , and dand : , as the . . in former Days , when they . tb instead of d , as for murder , and d for . , as . for mother . Has a hard and loft Sound according . it . to come before particular . , . , before a , o , and u , it is generally hard , as in game , gore , gun , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . except goal , when it a Prison , which sounds jail , and . be so wrote ; but before ⸗ and i it has commonly a soft and easy Sound , like the Letter j , as in . , . , ginger , danger , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c , except in the following Words , where it retains its hard Sound , as . . . , anger , get , beget , auger , geld , gelding , linger , finger , longer , eager , ty , , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . also begirt , begin , iu , gig , giggle , gift , . . Gilbert , . , girt , gimlet , give , gimp , gills , gild , girt , gird , . , . , pig , piggin , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & e . It is also hard by the Addition of u , as . , guilt , guide , guile , beguile , guise , disguise , guild , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . It has a . Sound at the End of Words , as si , bring , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . as will be the in treating of . Sounds , bus 1 . . GRAMMAR . . but it is not pronounced at all at the Beginning of Words , as gnat , . , gnast . It is written in many Words where the Sound is not perceived , both in the . and at the End , as , seraglio , sen , design , . , si , resign , condign , deign , feign , reign , arraign , foreign , , phlegm , bagnio , . , malign . When joined to b thus gb , in the lame Syllable , it sounds like . , as laugh , . , . , Bough , . , . , as it wrote , . . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . but . ; , like e final , serves to lengthen the Syllable , as sight , light , might , tight , weight , bright , . , si , fr , . , . , . ; though after all , the Sound of this Letter g is very uncertain , for in monger it is hard , but in manger it is soft . . So likewise when it is double in the . of Words , as dagger , swagger , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . both are to be pronounced hard ; but in the word su , the si is hard , and the second soft . , as if it were wrote thus , . . Allo observe that g is never double at the End of Words , except in ege and . , and even here it might be spared . H . the eighth Letter , and si Consonant in our Alphabet . Some Gentlemen over curious in their have very much contested whether it is a Letter or no , calling it only a mere Aspiration or Breathing , tho in our Language all the World ( who are not blind ) may plainly see it is really , and to all . and Purposes , as much a Letter as any other Consonant in the English Alphabet ; for as its Aspiration . one Noun from another , as edge and . , so it allo distinguishes one Verb from another , as to allow , to ballon , and a Verb from a Noun of the lame Signification , as , an owl , to . , and a Verb from a Pronoun , as , it , to bit , all which will be afterwards seen in the List of Words , . when b is and is not . , and also in my . upon this Letter . H is not pronounced at all , either at the Beginning Middle , or End of many Words , as may be seen in treating 1 4 Complete . Grammar . treating of b redundant , to which I refet , as to its proper Place . Has a long and short Sound according to its si ; when it is long it is pronounced like ei and . of the . in , a Kingdom , Ley , a Law , as mine , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . when it is short it is sounded like the j of the French and other Nations , as bit , . , win , pin , twin , thin , din , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . nor is it always owing to the silent e that i is lengthened , as in bite , . , wine , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . for it has the same long Sound where . follows , as bind , bind , kind , mind , blind , grind , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . and allo in Verbs that have an . , denoting the . of e , as , , , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . There is also a third Sort of i , sounded like ee , as oblige , which is pronounced . , much like the French . and Machine , which last are also become . Words . It is sounded full and long in most proper Names , as . , . , . , . , . . but when followed byr , it is pronounced like u , as in these Words , bird , birch , birth , . , firm , girdle , vi , fir , . , stirrup , spirt , shirt . . , . , . , si , dirt , . , fr , third , ty , thirteen , si , . , . , . , . , . , but the Word girt is often pronounced gal . It is in . , . , praise , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . and many more , as will be . afterwards in treating of : redundant . It is . in venisön , su , . , . , , regiment , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & ec . This is the jota lo much . in most of the modern Languages , and is very properly so called , having a tail joined to the ll i , and a jot or dot over it . It . very much in Sound from the aforegoing Vowel i , and therefore it is an unpardonable Fault to pronounce it i , instead of j or jay , which too many of . . Teacher are apt io do in ( ll , for A Complete . GRAMMAR . . for its true and genuine Sound is a Compound of d and y , as , for gentle , and . for lodging . Its . is to the Sound of g before any of the five Vowels a , e , i , o , u , as James , Jesus , Jilt , Joseph , . , which otherwise . be Games , . , . , . , . . It always begins a Syllable , and is constantly placed before , but never after a Vowel . It has an unvaried Sound , being pronounced every where like soft g , as . been . ; but when g is sounded soft at the End of a Word , it is . by g followed by silent e , as rage , sage , wage , and at the End of some Words by . , as . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . Many Words that now begin with g ( / were originally spelt with j , as . for gentleman , and indeed ought to be always thus written ; but we must conform to the arbitrary Power of Custom , which has decreed otherwise . K Is of frequent Use in our Language , having exaCtly the same Sound as in Italian , and . in . and . . Many are the . that have arisen , and are still , whether be a digerent Letter from c . The following Word , which is by some begun with , others begin with e , as . or . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . but if we consider the natural hard Sound of 4 before any of the five Vowels , we ll not be at a Loss to give k the Preference in the above Example ; besides , the Contraction of this Word itself is wrote with 4 , and not with c , as Kate or Kitty ; and although Custom has established that the Sound of this Letter at the Beginning of any Word before a , o , or u , ll be always . by c , as cat , con , cup , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . yet we find 4 is always used . . follows , as spake , spite , oke , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . which else would be space , spice , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & ec . Itis entirely redundant at the Beginning of Words , as may be seen in farther treating of this Letter . . Is twelfth . our Alphabet , and one of . ⸗ Consonants called liquid , because of its soft and melting Sound . * It 14 4 . . GRAMMAR . It is now . a general Rule ( except in . of some Persons ) that Words of one Syllable have double . the End , as ball , ball , full ; but when it . Words of more Syllables than one it is single , as handful , su , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . except these Compounds , bat - ball , cat - hall , cat - call , Ee . It sounds like m in . , and liker in Colonel . Its Pronunciation is very obscure in all the following Words , balm , calm , palm , . , alms , balk , . , , stalk , walk , salve , calf . . , Lincoln , . , , Norfolk , Suffolk , folks , . , . , . , . , fault , vault , soldier . M Is a Semi - vowel that always retains its natural and genuine Sound , as dram , dream , . , rim , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . It is never double in Words of one Syllable , but frequently in Words of two or more , as command , com , commit , commotion , communion , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . It is pronounced quick , as if wrote with two , in these words , comet , homage , image , and sounds like u in com . Is the fourteenth Letter of our Alphabet , and by . who have divided the whole into proper . is . ll , . Consonant . It is never double in Monosyllables , as can , pan , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . but often in Words of two or . Syllables , as cannot , cannibal , annual , nn , nn , cunning , cinnamon , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . nor at the End of Words , except Lynn , a Town in Norfolk , and Inn , a public victualling House , to . it from in , a si . It is not pronounced , though wrote , after m , at the End of Words , as may be . in treating of u redundant . Is the fifteenth Letter , and fourth Vowel of the . Alphabet , and has both à long and .

The . is pronounced like the . o , Omega , and as the . au , in these Words , , mole , more , It is long in Syllables ending in ab , as low , . . crow , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . but these following differ widely in Sound , how , now , cow , . being something . . There are but few . Words ending in o , which are these twelve following , do , go , bo , no , , lo , to , too , . , unto , . , . . The Sound of o , at the End of Words , being generally . by ow , except these sive , toe , foe , . , doe , . . It has sometimes a broad Sound like aw , as fond , folly , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . which is the fame with a in fall , and au in fawn , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . The . is pronounced in these Words , cot , got , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . and sometimes like the obscure u , as abbot , armor , . , . , . , ambassador , . , . , besom , colour , . , columbine , comfort , . cian ; compass , kingdom , London , monk , opinion , second , . , wisdom , won , word , work , wort , world , . , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . as if written , . , . , , .

Itis double in many Words in our Language , and then both are to be pronounced together with a long and . Tone , like the Italian u , in . , raw , viz . boot , . , coop , groop , . , poop , . , . , but door , floor , moor , are excepted , being to be founded like a single o long , thus do - ur , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . as the Dutch do ; but it sounds like short u in these Words , flood , blood , foot , soot , which were formerly wrote , fud , Mud , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & o .

It is transposed in apron , citron , iron , saffron , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . or , rather , it has the Sound of u , as . , . It begins double only in this one Word , . . it is not pronounced at all in words that are of Greek Extraction , nor in . ending in ous , as amorous , pious , generous , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . and many of the like Sort , as may be seen in the List of Words , treating of o redundant . Is the si Letter of our Alphabet , called a Consonant . It generally retains its natural Sound , but when followed by changes . , both at the Beginning , Middle , and End of Words , as . , . , triumph , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . as may be in the List of Words of Peculiar Sound in ph . But observe , . must be parted in these Words , uphold , upholsterer , . , . . It is frequently double in the . , but never at the End of Words , as apple , apply , approve , ty , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . But these two Words , copy and couple , though they sound like two , have but one , according to their respective Origin ; the former being of Latin , the latter of French Extraction . It is entirely su in all these Sort of Words , viz . attempt , receipt , empty , as may be seen in the List of Words treating of p redundant . 84 0 <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & Complete . nn . . 7 Is a mute Letter , and by the ati is . changed into e , as of . come . , of . . . ; but in . it is pronounced . , like the Words cue or kue , and when joined to other Letters , has always u after it , making a liquid Sound , as . , . ; . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & ec . though . u . quite . , the g being entirely si of both Letters .

But I . have remarked a great Deficiency among us , as as among the Scotch and . , some oß whom are apt to pronounce it too strong , . we pass it over so flighty , as scarcely to give it any Sound at all ; fot in the following , and many other . our common People pronounce not half their Letters ; as in ty . artifice , argument , parliament . <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c .

It is double in the Middle of the following Words , and many others , but never at the End , vix . arrogance , ati , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . May be very properly called the Snake Letter , as well by reason of its being made in . , double and twisting , like that Reptile , as because it is sounded by turning the Tongue upwards , and striking it towards the Roof of the Mouth , and then si forth the Voice by a kind of Sibilation like a Snake . It retains its natural hard Sound in these Words , ur , . , this , pes , . ; but towards the Close of Words it generally has a more obscure and soft Sound , like z , as also when it comes between two Vowels , as advise , . , . , demise , . , present , presume , . , . , . , . , . , please , . , cheese , rese , dose , chose , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . Although this Letter seems very regular in its Sound offe at the Beginning , and es at the End of Words , yet it is too apt to be mistaken for c , especially at the Beginning ; but by observing the following Rules and . , the . may be easily removed . Note then , that . Words beginning with the Sound . , before e , i , or y , must be written with , except these following , viz . cease , cedar , civil , cieling , city , Cybele , . , . , . , cymbal ; also the Sound of s in the Middle of Words is usually written with i , and not c , except thele , viz . acerbity , adjacent , . , artificer , ancestor , cancel , cancer , chancel , chancellor , chancery ) , . , conceal , concede , conceit , ance , concert , concern , concenter , concession , decease , deceit , , decent , deception , exceed , excel , ll , . , . , grocer , imperceptible , incendiary , incense , incarcerate , incentive , incessant , ince , innocence , intercede , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & ec . and many more that may be found interspersed in our Language . Also most . ending in the Sound of arce , . , . , A Complete . GRAMMAR . 19 . , . , must be written with : . and e , except farce , scarce , amerce , fierce , pierce , source , . . After ou , s and not e must be written , as . , . , and so in Verbs , to . , to mouse , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . unless n . , and then it must be with c , as bounce , flounce , paunce , ounce , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . But here it . be observed , that the above Words , house , . , are to be pronounced hard like ce , when used as . , but very soft like z when they are Verbs . Note , these five Words have the Sound of / b , as füre , su , su , . , su ; allo that ci , . , ti , found . alike , both in Spelling and Pronunciation , as , suspicion , si , . , imitation , action , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . as will be seen hereafter , when we treat of these Terminations . . . Is one of . Letters called a Consonant , and has three . Sounds before the Vowels ; the first and most natural is hard , as pity , city , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . which by the Way has the Sound of two ; the . is . ch , as question , celestial , . ; and the third like sb , as nation , potion , expatiate , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . all which . may be seen at large in my List of Words , treating of Sort of Sounds . It is but little sounded between two s\'s , as . , . , . . It is double in the Middle , but never at the End of Words . It is pronounced like ; in all the following Words , . , basten , . , . , pistle , epistle , apostle , jostle , bustle , castle , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . but quite lost in . , . , . , . . It is entirely superfluous in the following Words , catch , stretch , ditch , botch , Dutch , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . and many more of the like Sort , as may be seen in the List of Words the where : is . redundant . Its Pronunciation is very peculiar when followed by b , as will appear in treating of peculiar Sounds in . . U 20 <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & Complete . .

Observe , a following Vowel of any Kind after a single Consonant naturally . the aforegoing . except when .

A Complete . Grammar . 21 These Words , would , should , . , sound . like oo , as if wrote , woold , . , . .

It never . a Word without the silent e after it , and often follows ! and r , as . , , carve , starve , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . It . very much from the aforegoing u , , both in Shape and Pronunciation , and therefore they are extremely erroneous who give it the Sound of u , instead of ve , or . ; it having a Sound very . the . . Besides , if it were indifferent which of them . be used , I would only . how such Persons would spell , divulge , vulgar , . , uvule , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . W Is a Consonant not used at all among the , nor among many of our . , except the . and . .

It has a Consonant after it in the Word . , which . it to have the Force of a Vowel . It follows tb , as . , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . and sounds exactly as the Latins do their u in . , lingua , su , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & ec . It always . a Word , because the Genius of our Language utterly . a bare or naked u , as pan , . , sow .

X At the Beginning of Words is sounded like z , ar . , . , iu , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . and at the End like . . , as hox , cox , fox , pox , für , vortex , which would sound . the same if wrote , . , . , sc . as would books , . , . , . , if . wrote with x , thus . , . , <tok.ocr tok.ocr="&"> & c . But to enter more minutely into the Pronunciation of this Letter , which has the Power ot Force of a . Consonant .
