- transcription: escriptorium, model: kraken/german print (standard model)
- text is unedited. the error rate (1st page) is roughly 2% (15/750*100) and mostly concerns old english /ſ/ = /s/ of which there are 38 instances raw and the others were misinterpreted as /f/. just skimmed through, all other characters were mostly  recognised correctly, hyphenation has to be adapted.
- the complete document transcription (segmentation: default model, transcription: kraken/german print) takes about 4min.
