Eſop's
fables
,
both
in
profe
and
verſe
,
will
allo
be
a
proper
inſtructor
;
and
as
they
advance
,
books
of
a
higher
ſtrain
,
and
a
more
ſpeculative
turn
,
may
be
put
into
their
hands
with
ſafety
,
fuch
as
the
Spectators
,
Tatlers
,
Guardians
,
the
Rambler
,
Idler
,
and
Adventurer
,
and
a
few
other
periodical
pieces
of
a
later
date
;
theſe
,
with
perhaps
the
works
of
our
great
poet
Mr
.
Pope
,
will
open
their
minds
to
all
the
beauties
of
our
admirable
language
,
and
ſhew
at
once
both
its
ſtrength
and
concifeneſs
.
From
this
ſtage
of
education
,
the
ſcholar
may
next
proceed
to
hiftory
,
in
which
extenſive
field
,
that

certainly

be

.
Every
Engliſbman
,
how
deſtitute
ſoever
of
other
riches
,
has
one
ineſtimable
treaſure
,
his
country
;
witl
.
that
treafure
,
and
all
its
advantages
,
it
ſhould
be
at
once
his
pleafure
and
his
boaft
to
be
thoroughly
acquaited
.
Nor
ſhould
the
pupils
delivery
or
manner
of
reading
be
omitted
among
the
reſt
of
his
inſtitutions
;
for
this
purpofe
,
perhaps
,
thoſe
works
which
we
have
in
blank
verſe
are
extremely
proper
,
and
a
portion
from
one
of
thefe
fhould
every
day
be
firſt
read
by
the
maſter
,
with
the
proper
pauſes
and
juſt
emphaſis
,
and
then
the
ſcholar
ſhould
endeavouto
imitate
him
,
as
far
as
his
abilities
will
permit
