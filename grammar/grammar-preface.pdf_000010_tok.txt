XIII
diſcoveries
,
yet
if
difappointed
,
ready
to
acknowledge
my
miſtake
.
As
I
have
been
thus
ſolicitous
to
add
to
the
grammatical
ſtore
,
by
my
own
labours
:
equal
pains
have
been
uſed
to
retrench
the
former
ſuperfluity
of
others
;
a
work
of
this
kind
ſhould
abound
with
all
the
rules
neceſ
.
ſary
to
inſtruct
,
but
not
to
embarrafs
:
it
is
deſigned
not
to
gratify
vain
ſpeculation
,
but
to
be
converted
into
practical
utility
.
It
would
have
been
needleſs
,
therefore
.
to
engage
the
ſcholar's
attention
upon
fubjects
not
immediately
uſeful
;
or
to
croud
the
page
,
as
others
have
done
,
with
a
multiplicity
of
notes
collected
from
the
Ancients
,
relative
to
the
definitions
,
diviſions
and
ſubdiviſions
of
Gramimar
;
all
theſe
the
learned
are
fuppofed
to
know
already
,
and
the
ignorant
will
find
it
a
ſuflicient
tafk
at
firſt
to
underſtand
the
more
material
parts
of
the
art
,
without
diving
thus
into
the
recefles
of
antiquity
for
freih
labour
.
Such
a
needlefs
diſplay
of
our
abilities
would
only
increaſe
the
Size
,
and
conſequently
the
price
,
of
this
volume
;
and
at
the
ſame
time
confume
thofe
hours
which
the
ſcholar
might
have
more
profitably
employed
in
ſtudying
the
neceflary
rules
of
the
language
.
There
is
a
delicate
ſimplicity
in
all
the
fineſt
works
of
art
,
and
this
ſimplicity
Grammar
ſometimes
teaches
;
let
us
,
therefore
,
not
admit
foreign
ornaments
into
a
work
of
this
kind
,
and
thus
deſtroy
the
force
of
our
precept
by
the
errors
of
our
example
.
